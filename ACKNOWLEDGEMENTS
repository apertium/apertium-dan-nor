 Thanks goes to mentors Francis Tyers, Kevin Unhammer and Jacob Nordfalk. The development benefited greatly from Kevin Unhammer's work on the Norwegian Nynorsk/Bokm√•l language pair and also the Norwegian-Norwegian online dictionary developed by Oslo University and the Norwegian Language Council.

This project was partly sponsored by Google Summer of Code 2013
